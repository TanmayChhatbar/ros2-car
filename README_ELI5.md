## Understanding ROS

- **What is ROS?**: Imagine you have a robot made of different parts - sensors to see, motors to move, and maybe even a camera to record. Each part may speak its own "language". ROS helps them all talk to each other smoothly.
ROS is a essentially a software Lego set for building robotic systems. It provides ready-made tools and libraries to handle common tasks like controlling actuators, processing sensor data, or even communicating with other robots.
In short, ROS is the software glue that connects all the hardware and software pieces of a robot, making it easier to build, program, and control robots.
- **Understand the basic tools** ROS2 provides with [Beginner: CLI Tools](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html) section
