# ROS2-car (WIP)

### Current status - 0% Complete

## Goal


- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
- Autonomous drifting capabilities

## Hardware Components

- **Desktop with ROS2**: Used for image recognition and high-level processing.
- **Raspberry Pi for Remote Control**: Handles remote control operations and communication.
- **Raspberry Pi/ESP32 for Low-Level Control**: Manages high-frequency tasks like steering and motor control.
- **Tamiya TT-02 Base**: Serves as the chassis for the autonomous car, providing a robust and customizable platform.

## Targets

- Validation in simulation.
-- C-based simulation for an AWD vehicle with a differential and drifting capabilities.
- Control development.
- deployment

## Future Goals

- Implementing a PID controller for better control of the car's speed and steering.
- Integrating machine learning algorithms for improved decision-making capabilities.
- Developing a user-friendly interface for easier operation and monitoring of the car's performance.
